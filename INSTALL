Before installing the prototype GENI clearinghouse software, you must
prepare your machine. This involves installing dependencies and
configuring the database (PostgreSQL).

 1. Install the Shibboleth service provider. This is done separately
    from the prototype clearinghouse installation. From the sp
    directory in the shib git repository and run the following
    scripts:

      prep-sp.sh
      install-sp.sh

 2. Copy the proto-ch directory onto the destination machine.

 3. Run the 'prep-ch.sh' script to install dependencies (packages and
    gcf) and configure the PostgreSQL database.

 4. In each directory within proto-ch (portal, sa, ...) run "sudo make
    install".

 5. Configure Apache to run the prototype clearinghouse services and
    portal.

    Add the following lines to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl:

      Include /usr/share/geni-ch/portal/apache2.conf
      Include /usr/share/geni-ch/sa/apache2.conf

 6. Restart Apache.

      /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/service apache2 restart

 7. Test the slice authority. From the proto-ch/sa directory, run the
    following command:

      curl  -k -T sample.msg https://host.example.com/sa/sa_controller.php

    That should output "created my slice 2" if everything is working
    properly. If no output is shown, look in
    /var/log/apache2/error.log for error messages that might indicate
    what the problem is.

 8. Copy the settings.php file (which contains the DB password) into place:

      sudo cp proto-ch/etc/settings.php /etc/geni-ch/.

 9. Log in to the portal. Navigate to:

      https://host.example.com/secure/home.php
