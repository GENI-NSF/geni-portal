    for each non-expired project. If the group gets created, all
    project members are added to the group. If the group existed and

    some delay in creating projects or adding/removing members from

    (#777), allow deleting group members - like when they are removed
    from a project (#805), allow deleting groups (like when the
    project is expired or the project lead no longer endorses using
    WiMAX with the project (#806), allow project leads to enable
    multiple projects for WiMAX (#807), and suport changing the lead
    of a project (#808). For all these cases, the changes take effect

    the WiMAX page. Note that the WiMAX button remains limited
    visibility.
