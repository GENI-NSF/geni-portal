  otherwise retains the funtionality of the previous clearinghouse
  server. To support this change, the `*_client` library functions have

  only the portal client.

    group. When loading the iRODS page, ensure there is an iRODS group
    for each non-expired project. If the group gets created, all
    project members are added to the group. If the group existed and
    this user just got an iRODS account, add them. Note that this adds
    some delay in creating projects or adding/removing members from
    projects. (#829, #830, #831, #832)

    users to change the project they use with WiMAX (#774), handle
    duplicate usernames (#776), support the agreed upon error codes
    (#777), allow deleting group members - like when they are removed
    from a project (#805), allow deleting groups (like when the
    project is expired or the project lead no longer endorses using
    WiMAX with the project (#806), allow project leads to enable
    multiple projects for WiMAX (#807), and suport changing the lead
    of a project (#808). For all these cases, the changes take effect
    when a project member - preferably the new project lead - loads
    the WiMAX page. Note that the WiMAX button remains limited
    visibility.
