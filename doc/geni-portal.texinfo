@chapter Installation

This chapter describes installing the GENI Portal and Clearinghouse on
CentOS 6.5.

@node Prepare host
@section Prepare the host

@subsection Disable SELinux
The GENI Portal and Clearinghouse are not compatible with SELinux, so
it must be disabled. To test for SELinux, use the @command{sestatus}
command.

@example
$ sestatus
SELinux status:                 disabled
@end example

@noindent
If SELinux is enabled, google "CentOS disable SELinux" for
instructions. Do not proceed until SELinux has been disabled.

@subsection Disable Firewall

@emph{N.B. This should not be necessary and this step should be fixed.}

Disable iptables during installation. Check for the minimum ports
later in the document.

@example
sudo service iptables stop
@end example

@section Install Shibboleth
