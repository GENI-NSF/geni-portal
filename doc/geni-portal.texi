@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@cindex introduction
@cindex PHP
@cindex Python
@cindex XML-RPC

The GENI Portal and Clearinghouse consist of two main bodies
of software. The portal is a web site written in PHP. The
clearinghouse is an XML-RPC server written in Python.

@chapter Installation

@cindex installation

This chapter describes installing the GENI Portal and Clearinghouse on
CentOS 6.5.

@section Prepare the host

@subsection Disable SELinux
The GENI Portal and Clearinghouse are not compatible with SELinux, so
it must be disabled. To test for SELinux, use the @command{sestatus}
command.

@example
$ sestatus
SELinux status:                 disabled
@end example

@noindent
If SELinux is enabled, google ``CentOS disable SELinux'' for
instructions. Do not proceed until SELinux has been disabled.

@subsection Disable Firewall

@emph{N.B. This should not be necessary and this step should be fixed.}

Disable iptables during installation. Check for the minimum ports
later in the document.

@example
sudo service iptables stop
@end example

@section Install Shibboleth

@emph{This section will be filled in later.}

@section Install GENI Portal

@emph{This section will be filled in later.}

@section Install GENI Clearinghouse

@subsection Install ABAC

@example
cd /usr/share/geni-ch
sudo bash
wget abac.deterlab.net/src/abac-0.1.7.tar.gz
ln -s /usr/lib64/libltdl.so.7.2.1 /usr/lib64/libltdl.so
tar xvzf abac-0.1.7.tar.gz
ln -s abac-0.1.7 abac
cd abac
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --bindir=/usr/local/bin \
        --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin PYTHON_VERSION='2.7' \
        --with-site-perl=/usr/local/share/perl5
make
make install
ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/_ABAC.* \
        /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
exit
@end example

@subsection Install AMSoil

Get AMsoil tar ball

@emph{N.B. Need to change to a publicly available URL or alter the
 download instructions.}

@example
cd /tmp
wget http://www.gpolab.bbn.com/internal/projects/chapi/AMsoil-gpo-0.3.2.tar.gz
@end example

@subsection Install chapi

@example
cd chapi/tools
touch ../etc/geni-chapi-githash
install-chapi-centos.sh
@end example

@section Installing Updates

From time to time new versions of the GENI portal and clearinghouse
software are released. Updating your system to the new versions of
software is generally an easy process.

Releases may be accompanied by special instructions that must be
performed before and/or after installing the new version of the
software. These special instructions are not covered by this manual.

@subsection Updating @code{chapi}
@cindex installing updates
@cindex update
@cindex chapi

Updating the clearinghouse software (``chapi'') from git involves
first updating to the latest revision of the software. Once the latest
version of software is obtained, execute the following commands:
@example
autoreconf --install
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --bindir=/usr/local/bin \
        --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin --mandir=/usr/local/man
make
sudo make install
sudo service apache2 restart
@end example

@subsection Updating @code{proto-ch}
@cindex installing updates
@cindex update
@cindex proto-ch
Updating the portal software (``proto-ch'') from git is very similar
to the updating the clearinghouse software above.  First update to the
latest revision of the software. Once the latest version of software
is obtained, execute the following commands:
@example
autoreconf --install
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --bindir=/usr/local/bin \
    --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin --mandir=/usr/local/man
make
sudo make install
@end example


@node Operations
@chapter Operations

@section Introduction

@section Project Lead Privileges
@cindex lead, project
@cindex project lead
@pindex geni-add-member-privilege
@pindex geni-revoke-member-privilege
User privileges are elevated by the @code{geni-add-member-privilege}
program. For instance, to elevate a user's privileges so that they can
act as a project lead and manage their own projects, invoke
@code{geni-add-member-privilege} with the @code{-l} option to grant
project lead privilege.
@example
geni-add-member-privilege -k <private key> -c <certificate> \
        -u https://ch.geni.net/ -l -m <member id>
@end example

@node System Administration
@chapter System Administration

@section CRL error
@cindex CRL error
In the file /var/log/apache2/ch_error.log the following errors are listed.

@example
[Tue Mar 31 16:08:05 2015] [warn] Found CRL is expired - revoking all certificates until you get updated CRL
[Tue Mar 31 16:08:05 2015] [error] [client 128.89.91.42] Certificate Verification: Error (12): CRL has expired
@end example

@noindent
The remedy for this error is to run the @code{geni-create-ma-crl} program and
restart the web server:
@example
sudo /usr/local/sbin/geni-create-ma-crl
sudo service apache2 restart
@end example
